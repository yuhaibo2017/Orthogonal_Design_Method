# The Orthogonal Design Method
This is the MATLAB code for generating experiment designs using the orthogonal table. Please note that: 

1. This is not a complete orthogonal design tables, only the cases that all factors have the same levels are considered.

2. Only the level number {2,3,4,5,7,8,9} are considered.

3. The total number of designs is N=level_num^strength_num, which can be too high for engineering problems. So carefully choose the strength_num.
